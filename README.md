<p><b>Abstract</b>
  <br>In automated photogrammetry of a small object, rotating the object provides an easier setting and more stable camera positions than moving the cam-era around the object. However, the static features in the background can confuse the structure from motion, which leads to the failure of reconstruction. We are addressing the problem by proposing a masking algorithm based on light field epipolar-plane images (EPIs). Using a simple EPI analysis and edge detection technique, a single light field image is enough to create an initial mask, which acts as a region of interest for an edge image. Lastly, binary morphological tech-niques are applied to obtain the final mask image. The result shows promising performances of 93.84% recall and outperforms comparable algorithms in accu-racy, precision, JI, and F1 scores with 98.39%, 97.75%, 91.86%, and 95.75%, respectively.
